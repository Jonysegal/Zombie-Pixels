Here's how i wanna improve the thing:
get rid of tiles. fug that. either the space is empty and there's nothing there in the bool map, or there's something there and it's an entity and that has definitions.
get rid of pointtyles. fug that too. anything mobile (ie zombos) will have a point member that's used for that type of shizz
